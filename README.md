# Sending Text Message using Python

To send a text message using Python, you can use the Twilio library. Follow these steps:

1. Install the Twilio library by running the command `pip install twilio`.
2. Create an account on the Twilio platform (https://www.twilio.com) to obtain the required credentials.
3. Import the Twilio client library by adding `from twilio.rest import Client` in your Python script.
4. Provide your `account_sid` and `auth_token` obtained from your Twilio account as authentication to interact with the API.
5. Use the Twilio client to send the text message using the appropriate method.

Ensure you have the Twilio library installed, and your Twilio account credentials are correctly provided to enable successful text message sending using Python. This code snippet simplifies the process of sending text messages programmatically.
